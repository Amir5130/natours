To install dependencies in this project run the following command:

```
pnpm install
```

To run the project run the following commands:

```
pnpm watch:sass
```

The `watch:sass` command will automatically compile scss to css.

and then run the live server using the following command:

```
pnpm live-server
```

Or you can run both commands at once using the following command:

```
pnpm start
```

This will run `pnpm watch:sass` and `pnpm live-server` at the same time.
